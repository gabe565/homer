## Getting started

Homer is a full static html/js dashboard, generated from the source in `/src` using webpack. It's meant to be served by an HTTP server, **it will not work if you open dist/index.html directly over file:// protocol**.

See [documentation](docs/configuration.md) for information about the configuration (`assets/config.yml`) options.

### Using docker

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /your/local/assets/:/www/assets b4bz/homer:latest
```

### Using the release tarball (prebuilt, ready to use)

Download and extract the latest the latest release (`homer.zip`) from the [release page](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/releases), rename the `assets/config.yml.dist` file to `assets/config.yml`, and put it behind a webserver.
 
```sh
wget https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/releases/latest/download/homer.zip
unzip homer.zip
cd homer
cp assets/config.yml.dist assets/config.yml
npx serve # or python -m http.server 8010 or apache, nginx ...
```

### Build manually

```sh
# Using yarn (recommended)
yarn install
yarn build

# **OR** Using npm
npm install
npm run build
```

Then your dashboard is ready to use in the `/dist` directory.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Add new themes.
- [ ] Add support for custom service card (add custom feature to some service / app link)
